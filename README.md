Instructions on how to run the docker image:
after the images are decompresed and added to your docker instance here is the commands to run them

-(Remove Blar pixels) $ docker run -d pixelremover test_3
# test_3 can be subtituted by any of the following test_1, test_2, test_3, test_4

-(clark and write savings algorithm) $ docker run -d clarkwrite

then run the resulting container/app in your docker
i'm also sorta new to docker so there might be a better way to run/ship the images

heres the what i followed to be able to ship the images:
